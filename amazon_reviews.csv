Joshua,"June 28, 2018","I got this in a rush when I needed a new headset. In hindsight a bit more research would have had me getting something else. As a precursor to the review I feel that it is worth noting that I am very rough on audio peripherals. I don't know why, but they usually last me about 6 months regardless of the quality and price. This is why I choose to buy at a cheaper price point more frequently rather than high-end less frequently.Pros:Price for the quality is greatDecent speaker/mic soundGood quality cable that is at least 6' longSits comfortably on the headStereo/mic to separate stereo and mic connector includedIn-line mic mute switch and audio volume adjustmentCons:The USB is only a power source for the blue lights on the headset (it is a bit misleading in its uses, but if I had researched it a bit more I would have found this out before purchase)The in-line mute and volume knob would be better with a mic gain knob as wellIt tends to make my head a bit sweaty (I have long hair and live in South Texas, US. So it is hard to find headsets that don't do that, but still something to keep in mind)The headset only goes on one way (The traditional right and left side is enforced by the mic only being usable one way. I know I am in the minority, but I like the mic being on the right side of my head)So this is absolutely worth the money, but if you are looking for a high-end headset this is not it. I know my cons were a bit nit picky, and I don't want anyone to think that I regret this purchase. I knew I was getting a quick solution to needing a headset, and I honestly got more than I was looking for. The USB lighting, while completely useless, is a cool addition. The only reason it didn't make it into the pros section is because unless you want to look cool on stream it is wasted resources.So, yea. If you want a good quality headset for a good price this is great for you.

Steven McCall,"February 16, 2024","Bought this due to needing something on the less expensive end to play Fortnite with my son on PS4.  These have exceeded my expectations.  Volume wheel is nice when needing to turn down and slide mute button.  If you want them to light up will need to plug into a USB port.  They still work without that.  Solid buy....

Tyson,"November 15, 2023","I've been using the G9000 headset for a few months now, and it's a solid choice for any gamer and works great for online meetings. First off, the sound quality is on point – I can hear every game detail, which ups my gaming experience. The bass surround is like being in the game! The mic is clear, and my friends hear me without any issues. It's also got this cool LED light that adds some style to my gaming setup. The only small downside is the plastic housing feels a bit cheap, but hey, it's a great deal for the price. In a nutshell, the G9000 is a winner for me.

Jason,"February 14, 2024","I have been using these almost 2 years before rating.They are comfortable and still work like new. I wish the microphone could bend towards me but it's only up and down. I will probably heat up the microphone bar and bend it closer to my mouth. I have to speak loud for gamers to hear me now.The volume doesn't get loud enough to hear people in my party even though on my S Series I have them max volume.I can hear them but I'd like it louder.The biggest problem is the usb A , to light the headphones up, and headphone jack are connected by a plastic block that prevent you from being able to light them up. See picture above.  So when I'm using these headphones plugged into my controller I can't light them up unless I use a battery bank. Non of my controllers have a USB A built in.

thos25,"November 30, 2023","My son goes through headsets like crazy. Usually they only last like 6 months to a year at best before the connectors start to go out and the headset needs replaced.Normally I get him the extended warranty on headsets but recently I must not have added it like I thought I did. When it went out I needed to get a new set and it happened to see an ad for this one online. I was skeptical given the low price and no name brand. But I figured it isn’t a huge loss of they were no good.I picked them up and let him try them. It only been a couple of weeks but he says the sound quality is comparable to other headsets he has had from turtle beach and Astro. He does think they look cooler too.All that being said, the real problem with headsets is longevity. I can’t speak to the longevity of these but the sound quality and look of them seems adequate. For now I’ll give 4 stars and can update later if they last longer or shorter time than expected.

H. C. Garcia,"June 20, 2021","This item is really great for the price! I really like that I can use them on my MacBook, on my HP laptop and on the Dell PC at work. There are so many products that I can't use on my MacBook that it was exciting that these headphones worked. I haven't used them for online gaming, but they have worked great for Zoom and solo gaming.I would love if they came in green too (as that would match the rest of my setup), but at this price, and with the way they actually function, colour is pretty minor. I also found the splitter cord a bit redundant, as I couldn't tell the difference with or without it- but then again, I can't do that on my brother's 100-dollar headphones either, so maybe it is just me. They a tiny bit heavy (I'm not aa big person), but I also find that issue with any noise-cancelling headphones. At least they don't pin my glasses to my head, which has hurt me on my other set of headphones.I'm not sure what people mean by them not being stone enough (at the loudest, the volume hurts my ears bit, so they're definitely loud enough), efficient enough (they do cancel out the noise- when they're on, I can't hear my window AC unit running and my dogs sound muted) or that the mic doesn't work (it has picked up my front door opening in another room when I'm on).Overall, they were a great purchase and I would definitely recommend them.

Tyson,"November 15, 2023","I've been using the G9000 headset for a few months now, and it's a solid choice for any gamer and works great for online meetings. First off, the sound quality is on point – I can hear every game detail, which ups my gaming experience. The bass surround is like being in the game! The mic is clear, and my friends hear me without any issues. It's also got this cool LED light that adds some style to my gaming setup. The only small downside is the plastic housing feels a bit cheap, but hey, it's a great deal for the price. In a nutshell, the G9000 is a winner for me.

Jason,"February 14, 2024","I have been using these almost 2 years before rating.They are comfortable and still work like new. I wish the microphone could bend towards me but it's only up and down. I will probably heat up the microphone bar and bend it closer to my mouth. I have to speak loud for gamers to hear me now.The volume doesn't get loud enough to hear people in my party even though on my S Series I have them max volume.I can hear them but I'd like it louder.The biggest problem is the usb A , to light the headphones up, and headphone jack are connected by a plastic block that prevent you from being able to light them up. See picture above.  So when I'm using these headphones plugged into my controller I can't light them up unless I use a battery bank. Non of my controllers have a USB A built in.

thos25,"November 30, 2023","My son goes through headsets like crazy. Usually they only last like 6 months to a year at best before the connectors start to go out and the headset needs replaced.Normally I get him the extended warranty on headsets but recently I must not have added it like I thought I did. When it went out I needed to get a new set and it happened to see an ad for this one online. I was skeptical given the low price and no name brand. But I figured it isn’t a huge loss of they were no good.I picked them up and let him try them. It only been a couple of weeks but he says the sound quality is comparable to other headsets he has had from turtle beach and Astro. He does think they look cooler too.All that being said, the real problem with headsets is longevity. I can’t speak to the longevity of these but the sound quality and look of them seems adequate. For now I’ll give 4 stars and can update later if they last longer or shorter time than expected.

H. C. Garcia,"June 20, 2021","This item is really great for the price! I really like that I can use them on my MacBook, on my HP laptop and on the Dell PC at work. There are so many products that I can't use on my MacBook that it was exciting that these headphones worked. I haven't used them for online gaming, but they have worked great for Zoom and solo gaming.I would love if they came in green too (as that would match the rest of my setup), but at this price, and with the way they actually function, colour is pretty minor. I also found the splitter cord a bit redundant, as I couldn't tell the difference with or without it- but then again, I can't do that on my brother's 100-dollar headphones either, so maybe it is just me. They a tiny bit heavy (I'm not aa big person), but I also find that issue with any noise-cancelling headphones. At least they don't pin my glasses to my head, which has hurt me on my other set of headphones.I'm not sure what people mean by them not being stone enough (at the loudest, the volume hurts my ears bit, so they're definitely loud enough), efficient enough (they do cancel out the noise- when they're on, I can't hear my window AC unit running and my dogs sound muted) or that the mic doesn't work (it has picked up my front door opening in another room when I'm on).Overall, they were a great purchase and I would definitely recommend them.
